# KilnTemperatureLogger
Temperature Logger for Pottery Kiln using raspberry pi, MAX31855, and K type thermocouple. 
  Currently: code only logs temperature and plots it live.
  Work in progress: to calculate temperature rate of change and display/plot the calculated value and or set an alert when it falls under some value.
